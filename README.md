The idea is too use a SCT 013 clamp sensor connected to a ESP8266 and LCD dispay
it should take accurate measurements at regular intervals, wifi capabilites would mean i would also like to add a reciever device to display the power usuage in another room.
so the use case would be one device and sensor clamped to your mains power cable going to your distribution board, displaying its readings on the attached LCD.
Whilst another device connects to the first and also displays the same readings in real-time
possibly use webserver host for displaying values and have the second device connect to that server for its readings, added benefit of displaying readings on smart phone too
